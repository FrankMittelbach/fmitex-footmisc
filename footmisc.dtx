%
% \section*{History}
%
% This package originated as support of a personal project, which I (Robin)
% was switching to \LaTeX{} 2e over the Christmas holiday period of
% 1993, using the first \ensuremath{\beta} release.
%
% In its first form, it was known as the ``footnote'' package, but by
% the time I had released it to CTAN, that name had already been
% used by a package written by Mark Wooding.  So the package is now
% known (as you can see) as ``footmisc''.
%
% Frank took over maintainence in 2018 but due to other committments never
% got around finishing the changes he started to make in 2018.
%
% In 2022 a few new options (\texttt{abovefloats} and
% \texttt{belowfloats}) got introduced and the package now works
% with \textsf{hyperref} regardless of loading order.
%
% FMi: TODO support dblfootnotes?
%
%
%
% \section{User interface~--- package options}
%
% The \textsf{footmisc} package provides several different
% customisations of the way foonotes are represented in \LaTeXe{}
% documents (the sources of the code in this package are various, but
% all of it has been massaged by the author; where the code comes from
% elsewhere, there are attributions given below, somewhere or other).
%
% The interface to the
% package's options is mostly rather simple~--- each one is presented as an
% option in the |\usepackage| command, and for most, nothing else
% needs to be done.  For example, to use a useful
% and consistent set, the author invokes the package with the
% command |\usepackage[perpage,para,symbol*]{footmisc}|.
%
% For a small number of options, there are additional parameters
% available; these are described in the subsections below.
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{perpage}}
% \label{sec:perpagedoc}
%
% This option resets footnote numbering for each page of the document.
% It needs at least two passes to do this correctly (though it comes
% as close as possible on the first pass).  You generally have to make
% two passes with \LaTeX{} anyway, to get the cross-references right,
% so an additional pass for this purpose shouldn't cause any
% additional problem.  The option includes code to report that
% `\emph{Label(s) may have changed}', which will help the poor user to
% realise that (yet) another run is in order.
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{para}}
%
% This option (derived from code by Dominik Wujastyk and Chris Rowley)
% causes footnotes to be typeset as a single paragraph at the bottom
% of the page on which they occur.  In the case that there is only one
% footnote on the page, no effect will be observed.  However, if there
% are several footnotes on the page, they will be run together in the
% page foot, each introduced by its footnote mark.  The original
% demand for the option came from the needs of those preparing
% critical editions; such documents typically have large numbers of
% small footnotes, which look ridiculous if each is typeset in a
% paragraph of its own; in most other disciplines, such multiplicities
% of footnotes represent mere self-indulgence: the author of this
% package is disgracefully guilty of this.
%
% Please note that ``old'' \LaTeX{} installations may have problems
% with the algorithm for \texttt{para} footnotes on very wide pages
% (for example, those used by the \textsf{a0poster} class).  Recent
% \LaTeX{} installations use an improved technique that is believed
% not to be susceptible to this problem.
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{side}}
%
% This option (suggested by Frank Mittelbach) causes footnotes to be
% typeset using the \cs{marginpar} command: this has the advantage
% that the note appears close to its ``call-up'', but has all the
% disadvantages associated with the \cs{marginpar} command (which
% consumes `float' slots, and doesn't always place itself correctly at
% the top of pages in two-sided documents).  Since the measure in
% which the footnote is to be typeset is likely to be pretty narrow,
% users of the \texttt{side} option are recommended also to use the
% \texttt{ragged} option, to avoid ugly spacing and line breaks.
%
% There is a further problem (apart from the occasional failure to
% place the marginal note on the correct side of the page) in
% two-sided documents: one would like `raggedness' to appear
% differently in different margins (setting the left, rather than the
% right, side ragged in the left margin).  (The author would welcome
% suggestions on means of addressing the problem.)
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{ragged} and \cs{footnotelayout}}
%
% The package provides facilities for ragged right setting of
% footnotes (so long as the \texttt{para} option isn't in effect).
% The change is effected by use of the command \cs{footnotelayout};
% the package inserts this command into the start of the argument of
% \cs{footnotetext} (in effect: \cs{footnote} works, roughly, by
% calling the guts of \cs{footnotetext} at its end).
%
% If you want to use some special effect other than ragged right, feel
% free to change \cs{footnotelayout} yourself: some intriguing (and
% completely undesirable) results are no doubt available.  Change the
% setting simply by use of
% \cs{renewcommand}\cs{footnotelayout}\texttt{\dots}\@.  The
% \texttt{ragged} option simply sets \cs{footnotelayout} to set
% \cs{raggedright} or \cs{RaggedRight} as appropriate.  (If you intend
% to use the \textsf{ragged2e} package, load it before
% \textsf{footmisc}~--- if \textsf{footmisc} finds \cs{RaggedRight} is
% available, it automatically uses it in place of \cs{raggedright}.)
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{symbol}}
%
% This option simply establishes that footnotes are `labelled' by
% a symbol sequence.  The command used is equivalent to that
% suggested in \LaTeX{} manuals such as Lamport's (the job performed
% by the option is very simple, and doesn't really need a package).
%
% Using symbols to `number' your footnotes can be problematic: there
% is a limited number of symbols, and \LaTeX{} will report an error if
% your footnotes exceed that limit.  To avoid such problems, consider
% the \texttt{symbol*} option, or the \cs{setfnsymbol} command (see
% the next two sections), or number your footnotes by the page (see
% section~\ref{sec:perpagedoc}).
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{symbol*}}
% \label{doc-symbol*}
%
% This is the \texttt{symbol} option, but with protection against the
% tedium that arises because of the instability of the
% \texttt{perpage} option.  When executing the \texttt{perpage}
% option, the package often allocates footnotes to the wrong pages,
% only to correct itself on a later run (having warned the user of the
% need for the later run with a `\emph{Label(s) may have changed}'
% message).  In these circumstances the \texttt{symbol} option is
% prone to producing \LaTeX{} errors, which stop processing, and
% confound automatic generation procedures.  In the same situation,
% the \texttt{symbol*} option produces information messages and a
% warning message at end document, and the user may scan the log for
% those messages \emph{after} processing has stabilised.  The option
% produces numbers (17 and higher, in the case of the default symbol
% set) in place of symbols, when the footnote number is too large.
%
% \subsection{The \cs{setfnsymbol} and \cs{DefineFNsymbols} commands}
% \label{footnote-symbols}
%
% These commands permit the definition and use of alternative
% (ordered) sets of symbols for numbering footnotes.  \LaTeX{} of
% course comes with such a set ready-defined, but the choice of
% symbols isn't universally loved.
%
% You may define a set of symbols with the \cs{DefineFNsymbols}
% command.  \LaTeX{}'s default set would be defined by the command: 
% \begin{center}
%   \verb|\DefineFNsymbols*{lamport}|%
%   \unskip\verb|{*\dagger\ddagger\S\P|\texttt{\char`\\\char`\|\%}\\
%   \unskip\verb|          {**}{\dagger\dagger}{\ddagger\ddagger}}|
% \end{center}
% Defined this way, the symbol set produces a ``counter too large''
% error; a robust version of the set (cf.~the \texttt{symbol*} option
% (see \ref{doc-symbol*}) using the \cs{DefineFNsymbols} command
% without the optional |*|.
% You may select a set of symbols by use of the \cs{setfnsymbol}
% command; so to restore use of the default set, you would type:
% \begin{center}
%   \verb|\setfnsymbol{lamport}|
% \end{center}
%
% This package defines a small selection of alternative sets of
% symbols, using \cs{DefineFNsymbol}:
% \begin{center}
%   \begin{tabular}{ll}
%     \texttt{bringhurst} & $*\,\dagger\,\ddagger\,\S\,\|\,\P$ \\
%     \texttt{chicago}    & $*\,\dagger\,\ddagger\,\S\,\|\,\#$ \\
%     \texttt{wiley}      & $*\,\mathop{**}\,\dagger\,\ddagger\,\S\,\P\,\|$
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% together with a version of Lamport's original set that, with doubled
% versions of $\S$ and $\P$, and tripled versions of everything but
% the vertical bars, provides a symbol range to cover counters up to
% 16.
%
% This last set, known as \texttt{lamport*} is selected as the default
% symbol set by the package.
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{bottom}}
%
% This option forces footnotes to the bottom of the page; this is only
% noticeably useful in case that \cs{raggedbottom} is in effect, when
% \LaTeX{} would normally set the footnotes a mere
% \cs{skip}\cs{footins} distant from the bottom of the text.
%
% There's a further infelicity in \LaTeX{}'s placing of footnotes of
% the bottom of pages: if a bottom float appears on a page, \LaTeX{}
% places the footnote \emph{above} it.  The \texttt{bottom} option
% places the footnote at the foot of the page.
%
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{moveskip} (new in 2022)}
%
% When the \texttt{bottom} option is not in force (i.e., in the
% default case) there is a strange discrepancy: on most pages the
% footnotes are attached a distance of \cs{skip}\cs{footins} from the
% main text, even if that is run short. However, whenever the is some
% infinite stretch on the page, e.g., from using \cs{newpage} or
% \cs{clearpage} the footnotes are pushed to the bottom (in particular
% on the last page of a document or chapter).
%
% This can be corrected by giving the option \texttt{moveskip} in
% which infinite glue just before the footnotes is removed and placed
% after them.
%
% This has the following effects: if \cs{raggedbottom} is in force,
% then the footnotes will always stay the same distance from main
% text and the bottom of the text may vary from page to page.
% However, if \cs{flushbottom} is force, e.g. in the \texttt{book}
% class, then the footnotes will only move if there is infinite glue
% directly at the bottom of the page. Only then, the footnotes will
% shift upwards.
%
%
% \subsection{Options \texttt{abovefloats} and \texttt{belowfloats} (new in 2022)}
%
%  FMi: write documentation
%
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{marginal}}
%
% This option adjusts the position of footnote mark relative to the
% start of the line in which they appear (the the option is
% incompatible with option \texttt{para}, for obvious reasons).
%
% When this option is in effect, the footnote is set
% \cs{footnotemargin} relative to the left margin of the page; the
% default setting for \cs{footnotemargin} is -0.8em, which means that
% the footnote mark will be set jutting 0.8em into the margin.  If
% \cs{footnotemargin} is a positive length, the footnote mark will be
% set with its right edge \cs{footnotemargin} from the margin.  (In
% the absence of the option, \cs{footnotemargin} is set to 1.8em; you
% may change that value with a \cs{setlength} command.)
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{flushmargin}}
%
% This option is as option marginal, but sets the footnote marker
% flush with, but just inside the margin from, the text of the
% footnote.
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{hang}}
%
% This option sets the footnote mark flush with the margin, and makes
% the body of the footnote hang at an indentation of
% \cs{footnotemargin} (if that is a positive distance), or the width
% of the marker (if \cs{footnotemargin}$\leq0$).  The option code
% itself leaves \cs{footnotemargin} at its default value of 1.8em.
%
% The footnote itself may of course be longer than one paragraph; if
% so, the paragraphs will be separated by the vertical space specified
% by \cs{hangfootparskip}, and the second and subsequent paragraphs
% are indented by \cs{hangfootparindent}.  Default values are:
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%   \cs{hangfootparskip}   & 0.5\cs{baselineskip} \\
%   \cs{hangfootparindent} & 0em
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% The user may redefine these values (using
% \cs{renewcommand}): it is best to use the font-size-dependent
% measures (multiples of \cs{baselineskip} for the skip, multiples of
% |em| for the indent).  Note that the default has only one of the two
% values non-zero; both zero may result in easily-missed paragraph
% breaks, and both non-zero is not generally thought to be a
% good-looking option.
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{norule}}
%
% This option suppresses the `normal' footnote rule, and advances
% \cs{skip}\cs{footins} a bit to compensate
%
% \subsection{Option \texttt{splitrule}}
%
% This option makes puts a full-width rule above the split-off part of
% a split footnote.  (Remember that split footnotes don't happen if
% you're doing paragraph footnotes.)
%
% The option provides three different \cs{footnoterule} commands:
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
% \cs{mpfootnoterule} & for use in minipages \\
% \cs{pagefootnoterule} & for normal footnotes on regular pages \\
% \cs{splitfootnoterule} & for the tail of a split footnote
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% By default, \cs{mpfootnoterule} and \cs{pagefootnoterule} retain the
% original definition of \cs{footnoterule} (which nay have been
% modified by a \texttt{norule} option), while \cs{splitfootnoterule}
% becomes a full-width rule.
%
% \subsection{The \texttt{stable} option}
%
% This option deals with the problem of placing footnotes in section
% titles (and so on).  While there is (sometimes, just) justification
% for putting footnotes in titles, \LaTeX's treatment of the content
% of titles militates against them.  Of course, the title argument is
% ordinarily a moving one, and \cs{footnote} is a fragile command, but
% the real problem comes from the way the argument actually moves~---
% which is to two places.  The argument moves to the table of
% contents, where the footnote will (at least) look odd.  But the
% argument also moves to the marks that make up page headers, etc.,
% and \emph{there} it creates havoc, since page headers are executed
% in page make-up, and page make-up \emph{must not} create footnotes.
%
% If you use the \texttt{stable} option, the footnote won't move to
% the table of contents or the page headers, but it will be typeset
% correctly within the title itself.
%
% The situation with \cs{footnotemark} is less dire (it could in
% principle appear in page headers, for example); footnote marks
% appearing on pages other than where their text appears are none the
% less confusing, and the stable option treats \cs{footnotemark} in
% the same way that it treats \cs{footnote}.
%
% \subsection{The \texttt{multiple} option}
%
% This option deals with the case where the author needs to type
% things like
% \begin{verbatim}
%   mumble\footnote{blah}\footnote{grumble}
% \end{verbatim}
% Without special treatment, \LaTeX{} would output something like
% \begin{quote}
%   mumble\textsuperscript{1314}
% \end{quote}
% \noindent What the \texttt{multiple} option makes of the above is
% \begin{quote}
%   mumble\textsuperscript{13,14}
% \end{quote}
% which is what most people would expect.  The comma separator
% actually derives from the definition of \cs{multfootsep}, which
% may be changed by \cs{renewcommand} if the option is in effect.
%
% The option also treats \cs{footnotemark} in the same way.
%
% \subsection{User interface~--- miscellaneous commands}
%
% The package also defines some miscellaneous footnote-related
% commands.  The present group provides alternative means of producing
% footnote marks: \cs{footref} and \cs{mpfootnotemark}.
%
% When you're in a minipage, \cs{footnote} numbers run according to the
%  minipage's own footnote counter, and the marks are set in italic
% letters.  However, the numbers used by \cs{footnotemark} make
% reference to the `main'
% footnote counter, and are set in whatever is the current style for
% that: this behaviour often surprises, and there's no obvious way in
% standard \LaTeX{} to ``get around'' it.  The command
% \cs{mpfootnotemark} gets around this problem in a minipage, by
% generating footnote marks in the same way as those used by
% \cs{footnote}.
%
% In fact, making reference to footnotes in
% general can be problematic: it can be done by noting down the
% value of the footnote
% marker in a counter (or the like) and then using the value in a
% subsequent \cs{footnotemark} or \cs{mpfootnotemark}.  This is a
% tedious way of going about things, and doesn't allow representation
% of all possible forms of footnote mark; \cs{footref} is a form of
% reference command that sets the reference as if it were a footnote.
% The label should be set \emph{within} the argument of the footnote
% command that is being labelled:
% \begin{verbatim}
% ...\footnote{Note text\label{fnlabel}}
% ...
% ... potato head\footref{fnlabel}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \section{User interface~--- interactions with other packages}
%
% The \textsf{footmisc} package modifies several parts of the \LaTeX{}
% kernel; what gets modified depends on the options you select.  This
% behaviour can cause problems with other packages, particularly those
% that also modify the kernel.
%
% Known interactions are:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\normalfont\textsf{setspace}] The \textsf{setspace} package
%   modifies the way line spacing is calculated in footnotes.
%   \textsf{Footmisc} knows about this, and preserves the change.
%   However, you \emph{must} load \textsf{setspace} \emph{before}
%   \textsf{footmisc}.
% \item[\normalfont\textsf{memoir} class] The class emulates
%   \textsf{setspace}, and we detect that emulation and deal with it
%   in the same way as \textsf{setspace}.
%
% \iffalse FMi: this should now work
% \item[\normalfont\textsf{hyperref}] The \textsf{hyperref} package
%   has ambitions to make hyperlinks from footnote marks to the
%   corresponding footnote body; naturally this causes grief to
%   \textsf{footmisc}, and unfortunately no remedy is currently
%   known.  If you use \textsf{footmisc}, suppress hyperref's
%   hyper-footnotes, by loading it as:\\
%   \quad\verb|\usepackage[hyperfootnotes=false,...]{hyperref}|\\
%   Further work on the interaction between the two packages is
%   proposed, but not yet scheduled.
% \fi
%
% \item[\normalfont\textsf{manyfoot}] The \textsf{manyfoot} package
%   permits several independent sequences of footnotes.  Some
%   preliminary work towards interworking with \textsf{footmisc} has
%   been completed, but more remains to be done at the time of
%   writing.

% \section{Code: Preliminaries}
%
% Well~--- here we go: let's make the package file:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*package>
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Now declare what environment we need:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[1994/12/01]
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% We need a token register in case we have to patch \cs{@makecol}:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newtoks\FN@temptoken
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \begin{macro}{\protected@writeaux}
% This command is defined for future compatibility with Matt Swift's
% \textsf{newclude} package (still, after all this time, not out of
% beta status).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\providecommand\protected@writeaux{%
  \protected@write\@auxout
}%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\l@advance@macro}
% \begin{macro}{@@dvance@macro}
% \begin{macro}{\@advance@macro}
% We make the following (\cs{@@dvance@macro}) generalisable as follows
% (the global form isn't used in this package \dots\ yet):
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\l@advance@macro{\@@dvance@macro\edef}
\def\@@dvance@macro#1#2#3{\expandafter\@tempcnta#2\relax
  \advance\@tempcnta#3\relax
  #1#2{\the\@tempcnta}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Now we define a jolly little macro to advance a macro count (|#1|)
% by a given amount (|#2|).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\@advance@macro\l@advance@macro
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\footnotemargin}
% Finally, we define the length used by the \texttt{marginal} option,
% and initialise it as if we've not had the option.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newdimen\footnotemargin
\footnotemargin1.8em\relax
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \section{Package options}
%
% Most of the code of the package is contained within the option
% processing, one way or another (that which isn't, is executed after
% \cs{ProcessOptions} as a result of flags set in the option
% processing).
%
% \subsection{The \texttt{symbol} option}
%
% This is a declaration that appears in the original \LaTeX{} book.
% Since it appeared in the old |pagefoots.sty| (presumably since it
% goes so naturally with the |perpage| option), I've added this
% trivial piece of customisation to the package.

% \subsection{The \texttt{symbol*} option}
%
% The robust version of the \texttt{symbol} option: if the current
% `symbol' option doesn't provide enough variants, use arabic footnote
% number.  We use a robust version of the ``extended ordinary'' symbol set,
% described later (in section~\ref{footnote-symbols}).

% \subsection{The \texttt{para} option}
%
% The basis of the code for this option comes from \TeX{}book, p.398
% ff.~(``Dirty Tricks''), though it does (of course) avoid
% redefining |\\| which has some other (somewhat significant) uses in
% \LaTeX{}!  The user should be aware of
% Knuth's note on the limitations of this method of doing the job: the
% \TeX{} stack is used four times per footnote, and the stack is
% limited (see the \TeX{}book, p.300 ff.).  If you have very large
% numbers of footnotes (in the hundreds), and encounter the error
% ``|! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry (... save size ...)|'', you may
% need to break your text into smaller sections and compile the
% separately.  Fortunately (say the comments on the original
% |fnpara.sty|) this is very easy to do with \LaTeX{}, provided that
% you reset the footnote counter to make the joins seamless.

% footnote marks and behave appropriately.  The trick is that
% both \cs{footnote}  and \cs{footnotemark} insert a marker (a
% cancelling pair of kerns of \cs{multiplefootnotemarker} (of opposite
% signs), which is detected in following \cs{footnote} or

% \cs{footref} addresses this problem by making a label reference that

% in the |memoir| class, and we therefore \cs{providecommand} it
% rather than defining it ``outright''.)
%    \begin{macrocode}
\providecommand*{\footref}[1]{%
  \begingroup
    \unrestored@protected@xdef\@thefnmark{\ref{#1}}%
  \endgroup
  \@footnotemark
}

% Syntax: \cs{mpfootnotemark}\oarg{number}
%
% Here we define \cs{mpfootnotemark}, which has the same syntax as
% \cs{footnotemark}, and which applies the semantics of
% \cs{footnotemark} to the minipage footnote series.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand\mpfootnotemark{%
  \@ifnextchar[%
    \@xmpfootnotemark
    {%
      \stepcounter\@mpfn
      \protected@xdef\@thefnmark{\thempfn}%
      \@footnotemark
    }%

    \csname c@\@mpfn\endcsname #1\relax
    \unrestored@protected@xdef\@thefnmark{\thempfn}%

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
%
%   If \textsf{hyperref} was loaded first, it has saved
%   \cs{@footnotetext} and \cs{@footnotemark} away and then redefined
%   them. The saved versions are now wrong, so we reassign them.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\@ifpackageloaded{hyperref}{%
  \let\H@@footnotetext\FN@footnotetext
  \let\H@@footnotemark\FN@footnotemark
}{%
%    \end{macrocode}
%   If \textsf{hyperref} wasn't loaded we copy our new definitions to
%   \cs{@footnotetext} and \cs{@footnotemark} for actual use. If
%   \textsf{hyperref} is loaded later it will do its magic and save
%   our definitions.
